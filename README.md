# Undying Run

**A continent run through Azeroth, forked from [Azeroth Survivors](https://wow.aethus.pl/) by
Aethus, run locally on a from-scratch WoW 1.12.1 client engine (Rust + [Bevy](https://bevy.org)).**

Pick a class and run the Eastern Kingdoms. The hero crosses the continent from Westfall to
Naxxramas faster than a mount, while enemies chase and die and every kill feeds your level-ups.
Classic WoW keys: **A** and **D** turn, **W** and **S** run. **No server, no login, no account** —
fully offline and self-contained.

### The Undying Run

- **Thirteen stops**, Westfall to Naxxramas, joined along the road so consecutive zones touch. The
  hero runs at twice his class's base speed, faster than a mount, and gains levels on the way.
- **A 3D route arrow** floats over the hero and points at the next stop, with the distance to it
  and the stops reached so far.
- **Healing on the road:** a heal gem lands ahead, toward the arrow, every 8 seconds (up to three
  waiting), so healing does not depend on kills.
- **Classic controls:** A and D turn, W and S run, Q and E strafe, and the camera trails your
  heading. See [CONTROLS.md](CONTROLS.md).
- **A run card on the pick screen** lists the stops with their level ranges. Battlegrounds are no
  longer in the picker, though their code remains.

### In this build

- **A character-create pick screen** built from the client's own glue art: eight races, both
  genders and every class the race can be. The screen opens on the run card, and your pick is
  remembered across reloads.
- **Level-up cards** that deal in, tilt toward the cursor and lift on hover. Their WoW item-quality
  colour says how strong a pick is, and each card lists exactly what changes, like
  `Damage 20 » 26` or `Targets 2 » 3`.
- **A class movement spell on F** from level 5, aimed where you face: Blink, Charge, Sprint, Dash,
  Fade, Ghost Wolf, Aspect of the Cheetah, Blessing of Freedom, Howl of Terror.
- **A camera that follows your heading** at a 61° tilt. Turn with A or D, or right-drag, and the
  camera swings with you. **C** swings it back behind the hero, and the wheel zooms from over the
  shoulder out to 70 yards.
- A light sharpen-and-colour pass over the picture (**G** toggles it).

## Play it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marekvi95/undying-run
cd azeroth-survivors-re
make build     # fetch game data + install toolchain + build the wasm (~5.5 GB download)
make start     # → open http://127.0.0.1:8090/
```

`make build` chains three re-runnable scripts, each skipping what's already done:

| Step | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/fetch-data.sh` | downloads the WoW 1.12.1 client and extracts its MPQs |
| `scripts/web-setup.sh` | installs the wasm toolchain (wasi-sdk, wasm-bindgen, binaryen) |
| `scripts/web-build.sh` | builds the client into `web/dist/` |

**Prerequisites:** [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), `make`, `curl`, `unzip`, and a bash shell. On Windows, run everything from Git Bash; PowerShell and cmd can't run the scripts.

To play the desktop build instead of the browser, point it at a client's `Data` folder:

```bash
WOW_DATA=/path/to/WoW/Data cargo run --release -p warcraft-survivors
```

`make native` does the same after fetching the data for you.

Run `make` (or `make help`) to list every target.

## Controls

See [CONTROLS.md](CONTROLS.md). The short version: **A/D** turn, **W/S** run, **Q/E** strafe,
**Space** to jump, **F** for your class's movement spell, the **mouse wheel** to zoom, **C** to
recentre the camera behind the hero, **Esc** to pause, **1/2/3** to pick a level-up card.

## The game data (not in this repo)

This repo ships **no Blizzard content** — no art, models, sounds, maps, MPQ contents, or
FrameXML. The game reads a WoW 1.12.1 client's `Data` folder at runtime, which you supply.

`make build` (via `scripts/fetch-data.sh`) downloads the **English WoW 1.12.1 (build 5875)**
client from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/WoW_1.12.1-5875) (~5.5 GB) and extracts the
MPQs into `wow-data/Data/` (git-ignored, resumable, skipped when already present). Or point at a
client you already have with `--data` / `WOW_DATA`.

### Changing the download source

If the archive.org item moves or you have your own mirror, override the URL without editing
anything:

```bash
make build WOW_DATA_URL=https://your-mirror.example/client.zip
```

Or set it permanently by editing the single clearly-marked `DEFAULT_DATA_URL` line at the top of
`scripts/fetch-data.sh`. Either way the URL must be a direct link to a zip holding the client's
`Data/*.MPQ` files.

## How it's built

The survivors mode is `crates/benilla-app/src/survivors/`, running on two upstream projects:

- [benilla](https://github.com/samwhosung/benilla) — a from-scratch WoW 1.12.1 client.
- [wenilla](https://github.com/Arnesen/wenilla) — benilla compiled to WebAssembly, with a local
  host and realm service.
